### Hi, I'm Martin 👋

A few facts about me:

- I'm a self-taught software engineer based in London, UK 🇬🇧
- I spent 8 years as a QA before getting a job as a dev 👨‍💻
- I've worked for companies like [Zoa](https://www.zoa.io), [Bulb](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bulb-uk), [ABOUT YOU](https://www.aboutyou.com) and more
- I once trained as a journalist, but it didn't quite work out... 🗞️

When I'm not coding, I very occassionally make _(terrible)_ music and upload it on [Bandcamp](https://playgroundmatador.bandcamp.com).

**Note:** I am actively coding despite the lack of activity on my profile, but my most recent company uses Gitlab company accounts rather than Github!
