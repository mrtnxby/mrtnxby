### Hi, I'm Martin 👋

A few facts about me:

- I'm a self-taught software engineer based in Lincoln, UK 🇬🇧
- I spent the last 10 years working in QA/Software Engineer roles 👨🏻‍💻
- I've worked for companies like [E.ON Next](https://www.eonnext.com/), [Zoa](https://www.zoa.io), [Bulb](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bulb-uk), [ABOUT YOU](https://www.aboutyou.com) and more

**Note:** I am actively coding despite the lack of activity on my profile, but my most recent company uses Gitlab company accounts rather than Github!
